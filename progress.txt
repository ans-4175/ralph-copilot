# Ralph Progress Log

This file is an append-only transcript of Ralph's work. Each iteration logs what was attempted, built, and whether tests passed.

## Format

Each entry includes:
- Timestamp (ISO 8601)
- Iteration number
- Feature ID and description
- Work summary
- Test results
- PRD updates

## Example Entry

```
[2026-01-25T04:00:00Z] ITERATION 1 STORY arch-001 (Setup TypeScript and testing framework)

Architecture check: YES — ready for initial setup.

Work done (arch-001 only):
- Created tsconfig.json with strict mode
- Installed Jest and configured jest.config.js
- Created src/ folder structure: types/, components/, lib/, service/, app/
- Added first test example in src/__tests__/setup.test.ts
- Ran tests: pnpm install && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test (all pass)
- Updated plans/prd.json: arch-001.passes=true
- Committed: [arch-001] Setup TypeScript and Jest

STORY_DONE
[2026-01-25T04:01:00Z] STORY_PASS arch-001 (tests pass + committed + clean)
```

## How to Read Progress

1. **Find your feature** — Search for the feature ID (e.g., `auth-001`)
2. **Check status** — Look for `STORY_DONE` or `STORY_FAIL`
3. **Review decisions** — Read the "Work done" section for implementation notes
4. **Verify tests** — See which test commands were run
5. **Check git** — Each feature should have a corresponding git commit

## Resume Workflow

If interrupted:
1. Check the last `STORY_PASS` or `STORY_FAIL` entry
2. Run Ralph again: `./ralph.py --allow-dirty --allow-profile safe --max-iterations 10`
3. Ralph reads PRD and `.ralph/state.json` to resume from the next incomplete feature
4. New entries append to this file automatically
